# GETTING STARTED

## 1. How to connect to the server.

Please download MacinCloud Connection Files from the following link: http://www.macincloud.com/images/MacinCloud_FF041.zip

- ***For Windows PC users*** - You do not need to install any additional software if you are accessing from a Windows PC computer. Simply double-click the MacinCloud connection file mentioned above to connect, and then login using the provided server username and password. If you are not familiar with the process, please view our Tutorial Video.

- ***For Mac users*** - Please first install Microsoft Remote Desktop App through the App Store by clicking HERE and then click the blue "View in Mac App Store" button. Once you see the App in the Mac App Store, click on the "Install" button to install the app. For Mac users who have earlier Mac OS (10.8 or earlier), you can download and install a legacy version of this app by clicking HERE. After installing the remote desktop app, simply double-click the MacinCloud connection file mentioned above to connect, and then login using the provided username and password.

- ***For Linux users*** - Please install rdesktop for your Linux distribution and use the connection information mentioned above. You need to include the port number (port 6000) in the server name field (i.e. [hostname]:6000).

- ***For all desktop users*** - In addition to the connection files, you may simply use your browser to connect to your server. Please login to the User Portal at portal.macincloud.com with your account email and select the "Action" menu next to your managed server name to connect.

- ***For mobile device users*** - You may access your server from iPhone, iPad and other mobile phone or devices (feature limitations may apply). Please follow this guide or visit our Knowledge Base for further instructions.

## 2. Utilize the User Portal at portal.macincloud.com.

The User Portal is a great tool for you to update your account information and manage your service.

After logging in to the User Portal with your account email, you will have access to many features allowing you to manage and update your service account. Please make sure to login using the same email you used during sign up.

Here are the main features included in the portal:

- Billing information update. You can update your billing information through the billing section.

- Use your browser to connect to your server. The "Action" menu next to your managed server name allow you to instantly connect to your server without additional software tools.
- Update and purchase more accounts. You can utilize the portal to update existing servers and purchase more server accounts.

## 3. Make sure to log off your Mac server account properly after you complete your usage.

You must log off your Mac server account from the Apple icon menu to end each usage session.

You may log in as frequently as you wish to utilize your MacinCloud Managed Server or Pay-As-You-Go hours. You login time will be calculated based on the total login time (from login to logout) of your Mac user account. Fail to logout from the Mac server after usage will cause billing to continue. You will be billed for any and all time your account is logged in on the Mac server. You may choose the No Daily Limit Plan to avoid overtime charges.

## 4. If you have difficulties connecting for the first time, please contact us.

The most common causes for connection difficulties are:
Your office or home firewall/antivirus is blocking the required remote connection port. (Port 6000 should be open)
Incorrect login name and password combination. Your Mac login information is listed above in the "Your Server Information" section. Your Mac server login username is not the same as your MacinCloud account email. Your account email allows you to access the User Portal and manage different services, and your server information allows you to access the actual servers.

***ACCOUNT AND BILLING MANAGEMENT***

Please access the User Portal with your account email to manage your billing information and access additional features.
